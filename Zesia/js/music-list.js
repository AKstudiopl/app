    bio: "Born in Syracuse, New York, Austin Post (July 24, 1995) moved to Grapevine, Texas, at the age of 9 and grew up absorbing his father's eclectic record collection which included Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Merle Haggard, playing out his rock star dreams on the video game Guitar Hero. He turned to a real guitar when he was 16 and began teaching himself to play with the help of online tutorial videos. He moved on to community college and worked shifts at a fast-food chain, but when his friend Jason Probst found success with a YouTube gaming channel and moved to Los Angeles, Post followed him to begin his musical career. Living in Probst's San Fernando mansion, he turned his bedroom into a studio while tirelessly working on writing songs, developing his guitar and rap skills, and making his own beats. Taking his moniker from a hip-hop name generator, he developed quickly from making mixtapes to playing in hardcore bands and appearing in Probst's videos. After working with producers FKi and Rex Kudo, he came up with his debut single. Two days after recording it, he uploaded 'White Iverson' to SoundCloud and received a huge response, including millions of plays and praise from Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller. A deal with Republic Records followed and the single reached Number 14 on the US charts, and after playing at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party, Post featured on Kanye West's single 'Fade' and became the opening act on Justin Bieber's Purpose World Tour in 2016. His debut album Stoney experimented with genres such as country, electronica, pop, and hip-hop and his single 'Congratulations' made the US Top 10. He scored his first Number 1 single with the trap-inspired 'Rockstar' at the end of 2017 and returned the following year with a second album titled Beerbongs & Bentleys, which featured appearances from Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla $ign and G-Eazy. In 2018, he collaborated with Swae Lee on the track 'Sunflower' for the soundtrack of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The track went to Number 1 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot 100, and Rhythmic charts. 2019 saw the arrival of 'Goodbyes' featuring Young Thug and 'Circles' before the release of third studio album Hollywood's Bleeding in September of the same year. The album hit number one on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. Featuring guest spots from Roddy Ricch, Doja Cat, Gunna, Fleet Foxes, the Kid Laroi, and the Weeknd, his highly-anticipated fourth studio LP Twelve Carat Toothache appeared in 2022 and debuted at Number 2 on the US rap charts. Preceded by the singles 'Chemical' and 'Mourning,' his fifth studio effort Austin hit the shelves in July 2023.",

A beef with , a film career, and even some reality show appearances would follow as the high-powered lyrical rap style of albums like 2019's Hotel Diablo morphed into a driving emo-rock sound on collaborations with  and on the -produced 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall, which topped the Billboard 200.

    bio: "With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever,’ the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? was written, produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY® Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently, Billie Eilish was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2021, and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything i wanted,' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To Die.’ Billie Eilish’s latest album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by Billie and her brother FINNEAS, who also produced the album.",

    bio: "Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.",

Parson James help cement Kygo as “the fastest artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify.” In the wake of his chart-topping 2016 full- length debut Cloud Nine, he delivered memorable performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Plus, he notably performed “Carry Me” during the Closing Ceremony of the Rio Olympics.",

    bio: "Multi-Grammy nominated Cuban born singer/songwriter Camila Cabello released her debut solo album, CAMILA in January 2018 to rave reviews. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart at the same time as her single “Havana” reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making her the first solo artist in nearly 15 years to reach the #1 spot on the Hot 100, Billboard 200 & Artist 100 charts in the same week. CAMILA launched its debut at #1 on 110 iTunes charts around the world, breaking the record for most #1 positions for a debut album in iTunes history. Camila also became the #1 artist on global Spotify.

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Tim Bergling’s death on April 20, 2018 was a shockwave, the global mourning an equal and opposite reaction to the Swedish producer’s intensely uplifting music and the reach it had during his comet streak of a career. As Avicii, Tim Bergling brought a pop sensibility to the electronic scene and helped redefine the global EDM phenomenon. His biggest tracks -“Levels”,  “Wake Me Up”, “Hey Brother” - were pristinely produced anthems of collective catharsis. His rise to fame and subsequent retirement was chronicled in Avicii: TRUE STORIES, filmed over 3 years and directed by Levan Tsikurishvili.  “I will however never let go of music,” he said at the time. “I will continue to speak to my fans through it. In this period, Bergling returned to place he felt best: the studio. This new project, TIM, is a 12-track collection of some of that new Avicii music. Produced primarily between January and April 2018, these songs represent Bergling’s most recent thoughts and vision. This project comes at the request and with the blessing of Bergling’s parents who wanted to see that Tim’s music was heard.  Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir and Carl Falk, Joakim Berg and Joe Janiak, who collaborated extensively with Bergling throughout his career, were enlisted to complete the tracks. But given how near completion it was, Bergling is still very much the producer of these tracks. While Avicii was Bergling’s brand, TIM is who he really was. ",

    bio: "Award-winning performer and Grammy-nominated songwriter Tove Lo crafts raw, confessional pop shaped by her love of grunge and the pristine sounds of her Swedish homeland. The way her 2013 single Habits (Stay High) swung between joy and despair and frankly depicted drug use and sex made it a distinctive, relatable, multi-platinum hit and a fitting introduction to her uncensored style. She followed it with more uninhibited, confessional music: Her 2014 debut album, Queen of the Clouds, and 2017's BLUE LIPS upheld her reputation for confronting the darker side of love and relationships with thoughtful, provocative, and catchy songwriting. On 2019's Sunshine Kitty, she took a slightly more lighthearted approach without losing any of her edge, while 2022's Dirt Femme lended nuance to her concept of femininity",

    bio: "Nicki Minaj skyrocketed from mixtape phenom to pop star with a unique combination of ferocity and humor she continues to flaunt with razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and a vocal style that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling. The rapper's early days included attempts at an acting career and losing her job at Red Lobster for being rude to customers, but she progressed quickly from MySpace demos to nationally adored mixtapes to household-name status. Pink Friday, Minaj's 2010 album debut, saw her appeal to a broader audience with chart-topping reception. Although she has had similar success with later full-lengths such as 2014's The Pinkprint and 2018's Queen, her singles have made an even greater impact.In just over a decade, Minaj has hit the Top 40 over two dozen times as a headliner with singles such as Super Bass, Starships, and Anaconda. These and other highlights were gathered in 2022 for Queen Radio, Vol. 1, an anthology containing the number one hit Super Freaky Girl among its new songs. Her Top 40 entries as a featured artist are even more numerous and include Kanye West's Monster, David Guetta's Turn Me On, and Ariana Grande's Side to Side. Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj in 1982. Born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago to parents who were both gospel singers, she lived with her grandmother in Saint James until the age of five, when she joined her mother, who had relocated to Queens, New York. In high school she discovered the performing arts, setting her sights on acting as her main pursuit. She eventually transitioned into music, working as part of a group called the Hood$tars in the early 2000s before going solo. In 2007 she was discovered by Dirty Money Entertainment CEO Big Fendi, who happened upon her demos on MySpace and signed Maraj to the label. At Fendi's suggestion, Maraj took on the stage name Nicki Minaj, jumbling her last name to reflect a more ruthless persona. Dirty Money Entertainment released both her 2007 debut mixtape, Playtime Is Over, and its 2008 follow-up, Sucka Free. Industry buzz was already surrounding Minaj on her earliest releases, and these mixtapes featured guest appearances from stars like Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Jadakiss, and Lil' Kim. Throughout the early 2020s, Minaj continued her usual bevy of guest features and collaborations, appearing on tracks by Doja Cat, former Little Mix vocalist Jesy Nelson, BIA, and Elton John. In 2022, she scored more hits as a lead artist with the Lil Baby collaborations Do We Have a Problem? and Bussin, then topped the pop chart with Super Freaky Girl. All three of these singles were included on Queen Radio, Vol. 1, a celebratory anthology released that August. Minaj kicked off 2023 with the flamenco- and trap-inspired Red Ruby da Sleeze, which she followed with a feature on YoungBoy Never Broke Again's WTF. ~ David Jeffries & Fred Thomas",

Upon release, Future Nostalgia was the most streamed album in a day by a British female artist globally in Spotify history and has over 4.5 billion streams to date. Dua is the biggest female artist in the world on Spotify and is currently the third biggest artist overall with nearly 60 million monthly listeners.

Tech’s multi-faceted skillset has not gone unrecognized by artists of all genres, exemplified by collaborations with such diverse artists as The Doors, Slipknot’s Corey Taylor, Eminem, and Boyz II Men, to name just a few. Everyone from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to Elton John has been spotted bumping Tech N9ne records, a testament to constant reinvention and inarguable excellence that has become standard of Tech’s work.

    bio: "Meiko's songs find common ground between indie pop and coffeehouse folk as her distinctive alto vocals share the spotlight alongside acoustic guitars, pianos, and unique arrangements. A longtime songwriter, Meiko was raised in the small town of Roberta, Georgia, where she discovered her love for public performance after singing at a Southern Baptist church. She then took up the guitar, playing her father's Gibson before receiving her own instrument as a birthday present. At the age of 18, Meiko left home for greener pastures, eventually resettling in Los Angeles and scheduling recurring performances at the Hotel Café, a popular haven for L.A.-based singer/songwriters.",

    bio: "Rosalía Vila (aka Rosalía) is a Spanish pop and flamenco singer. Involved in the margins of popular and traditional music since her teens, she also delves into other genres such as hip-hop, soul, and trap. Her voice has been described by no less a talent than flamenco guitarist  as sharp and sweet, but with a bite, like the old ones After her 2017 debut album Los Ángeles garnered attention from the U.S. public and earned her a Latin Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, her 2018 follow-up, El Mal Querer, was a major critical and commercial breakthrough, topping Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart and eventually winning a Grammy. The single La Fema (feat. ) appeared in 2021. Her third long-player, Motomami, offered songwriting collaborations with many artists and producers including  and . The 16-track album was released in March 2022, following a performance of the single Chicken Teriyaki on Saturday Night Live. Rosalía was the first Spanish singer to perform solo on the program. Enthralled by flamenco since childhood, Rosalía began performing as a teenager. She soon assembled an eclectic and intriguing curriculum, including appearances in prestigious Spanish and international festivals and collaborations with other artists, and the theater company La Fura del Baus. She also began posting videos of her performances to YouTube and gained a substantial number of social media followers. 2021 saw Rosalía team with Dominican rapper  on the single Linda. Later that year she issued the electro-bachata track La Fema, the -assisted lead single from her third full-length effort, Motomami. Appearing in March 2022, the long-player's 16 tracks utilized the production talents of Noah Goldstein, Sir Dylan, , Michael Uzowuru, , Sky Rompiendo, and several others. ~ Thom Jurek & Mariano Prunes, Rovi",

    bio: "From an Hispanic background, Selena Gomez was mostly raised by her mother - former actress Amanda Teefey - and developed her interest in the stage at a young age. She got her first break when she was 10 in the 2002 TV series Barney & Friends and made her film debut a year later in the movie Spy Kids 3-D Game Over. She went on to play Mikayla in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana and then took the lead role of Alex Russo in Wizards Of Waverly Place. Her first record was the theme song from the series, Everything Is Not What It Seems. Dating fellow Disney star Nick Jonas at the time, Gomez starred in the video for the Jonas Brothers hit Burnin' Up and recorded her own tracks like Cruella de Vil and Fly To Your Heart (soundtrack to the animated film Tinker Bell). She then sang on the Forever The Sickest Kids single Whoa Oh (Me Vs Everyone) and, on the back of an appearance in the movie Another Cinderella Story, had her first hit in 2009 with Tell Me Something I Don't Know. She also appeared in the reality series Jonas Brothers: Living The Dream and recorded the song One And The Same with her close friend Demi Lovato. She subsequently decided to concentrate on her music, forming the band Selena Gomez & The Scene and recorded her 2009 debut album Kiss & Tell, producing the hit single Naturally and breaking into the US Top 10. Meanwhile she continued her acting career, playing a more adult role in the movie Ramona & Beezus, appeared in various TV commercials and launched her own fashion range before releasing her second album A Year Without Rain. Gomez gained further attention when she started dating Justin Bieber and had another hit in 2013 with Come & Get It before releasing what was billed as her first solo album without The Scene, Stars Dance.

    bio: "Rihanna established her pop credentials in 2005 with Pon de Replay, a boisterous debut single that narrowly missed the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and fast-tracked her to becoming one of the most popular, acclaimed, and dynamic artists in postmillennial contemporary music. Until the Barbados native took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s, she was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of the pop chart. Through 2017, mixing and matching pop, dancehall, R&B, EDM, and adult contemporary material, she headlined 11 number one hits, including Umbrella and Only Girl (In the World), singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications.",

    bio: "Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history, and easily one of rap's biggest crossover successes. He was the first white rapper since  to garner both sales and critical respect, but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction. On sheer technical skills, Eminem is one of the greatest MCs of his generation: rapid, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides.",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: a singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras, creating a sound that's idiosyncratic and personal. Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path -- elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits The A Team, Sing, Thinking Out Loud, and Shape of You -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut, +. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including Khalid, Camilla Cabello, Cardi B, Justin Biber, Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars",

    bio: "Whether you’re aware of Minus Manus already or not, the impact of his influence across European pop music can not be denied. Real name Magnus Bertelsen, the young artist has amassed Number One singles in five different countries and over 2 billion worldwide streams through his work as a producer and songwriter. He helped Alan Walker land some huge international hits with the likes of ‘Sing Me To Sleep’, ‘Different World’ and ‘Lily’ (the last one has been in the Billboard EDM top20 for over 20 weeks). But now the Norwegian mastermind has allowed his take on intense, dynamic and infectious dance-pop to blossom as he goes it alone. Taking inspiration from Max Martin’s pop production and mixing it with dance floor ready beats, Minus Manus could soon become as synonymous with main room clubs himself.",

    bio: "An effortless storyteller with a pure and unfiltered singing talent and songwriting ability, Mabel McVey has an instinctive gift of melody far beyond her twenty three years. Indeed Mabel has made quite the impression since bursting on to the scene in September 2015 with her release‘Know Me Better’. Quietly released onto Mabel’s personal SoundCloud, the single didn’t remain a secret for long, putting the wheels in motion for Mabel to become a fresh and exciting name amongst a brand new generation of r’n’b chanteuses. In the three since, Mabel’s growth (musically, emotionally, visually) has been extraordinary. Her formative material led to the surprise breakthrough of ‘Finders Keepers’ in 2017, which went platinum, spent 5 weeks in the top 10, and saw Mabel nominated for her first BRIT Award (Critics’ Choice). She has gone from playing nervous, intimate shows to touring with Harry Styles, selling out her own dates around the world (including London’s Brixton Academy) and has clocked up increasingly-surreal experiences en route(which includes playing Wembley Stadium in a Burberry catsuit and rainbow flag). Over two million single sales in the UK and over half a billion streams followed. Mabel has emerged as one of the UK’s most positive, candid lyrical voices, with songs that frequently explore everything from identity, the challenges of modern relationships, and working out who you are and what you want.",

    bio: "Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Others have performed similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring pop culture icons based on their 1970s work -- but Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was perhaps the sharpest, savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute Tim McGraw, but her second album, 2008's Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits Love Story and You Belong with Me, but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Speak Now, delivered almost two years later, consolidated that success and moved Swift into the stratosphere of superstardom. Her popularity only increased over her next three albums -- Red (2012), 1989 (2014), Reputation (2017) -- and found her moving assuredly into a pop realm where she already belonged. Even when she scaled back her approach with 2020's stripped-down sibling releases folklore and Evermore, she remained atop the pop world, a position she maintained with re-recordings of her back catalog along with Midnights, a moody album released in 2022.",

    bio: "DJ/Producer phenom Alan Walker captured the imagination of the public with his debut single Faded in 2015, which served as a springboard towards an extensive and dedicated community. Notably, being one of the most followed accounts on Spotify and boasting more than 50 billion audio and video streams. Walker is widely recognized by his melancholic melodies yet optimistic lyrics. At the age of 24, Walker is already on his way to solidify himself as a usual suspect within the sphere of EDM. His successful singles and collaborations include Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, Avicii, Sia, Steve Aoki, A$AP Rocky, Ava Max, Kygo, Hans Zimmer, Madison Beer, Imanbek and many more. Inspired by his deep-rooted love for film and music, he has created an elaborate fictional universe, World of Walker, that accompanies his music videos, engaging fans across several mediums. World of Walker blurs the lines between fiction and reality, by inviting the community to grow and interact with an ever-expanding gallery of characters. Walker memorialized his first world tour through his movie, Aviation Movie, released in June 2021. The movie combines footage from his sold-out concert at the Oslo Spektrum stadium, with a storyline from World of Walker. Creating a unique, and interactive experience, that merges the world of cinema and music. Join the World of Walker and be a part of the movement.",

    bio: "Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning Hotline Bling and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring the Weeknd's early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022's Honestly, Nevermind became cultural events.",

Mit ihrer frechen und unverfälschten Art hat sie über Nacht unsere Herzen erobert. Für die einen ist sie dabei arrogant und trotzig. Für andere ist sie unzensiert, ehrlich und direkt. Lena ist all das, gleichzeitig nichts von dem und doch so viel mehr. Am Ende ist Lena nur Lena - eine junge Frau, die von einem Tag auf den anderen in das globale Rampenlicht trat. Sie musste lernen, mit ihren Erfahrungen wachsen und die Autonomie ﬁnden, ihren eigenen Wünschen fernab von äußeren Erwartungshaltungen nachzugehen. In ihrem 5. Studioalbum hat man mehr denn je das Gefühl, dass ihr das gelungen ist. Lena ist nach wie vor Lena und trotzdem anders - befreit, erwachsen und voller Lebensfreude. Ihre Botschaft lautet Only Love und das hört und spürt man in jedem Song.",

    bio: "Daria Zawiałow - jeden z najmocniejszych głosów na polskiej scenie muzycznej. Autorka tekstów oraz kompozytorka. Swoją charyzmą rozkochała w sobie tysiące fanów i stanęła w szeregu topowych polskich wokalistek. Na scenie jest wulkanem energii. Poza sceną jest skromną, normalną dziewczyną, lecz nadal świadomą i bezkompromisową artystką. W 2016 roku szumnie zaznaczyła swoją obecność na rynku singlami „Malinowy Chruśniak“ i „Kundel Bury“. Na początku 2017 roku zadebiutowała albumem „A kysz!“. Niemal od razu po premierze Daria została okrzyknięta objawieniem roku, a chwilę potem została nagrodzona dwoma Fryderykami. Dwa lata później światło dzienne ujrzał album „Helsinki“. Płyta po kilku miesiącach uzyskała status platynowej i przez 70 tygodni utrzymywała się na OLiS. „Hej, Hej!“ – potrójnie platynowy singiel z płyty – przez 4 tygodnie z rzędu był najczęściej granym utworem w polskich radiach. „Helsinki” również zostały uhonorowane Fryderykiem. W międzyczasie, z fantastycznym zespołem u boku, Daria zagrała setki koncertów na największych scenach w Polsce. Jej ostatnia trasa Helsinki Tour jeszcze przed startem została wyprzedana. W 2019 roku Daria była najczęściej słuchaną polską artystką na Spotify. Rok później została ambasadorką trasy Męskie Granie współtworząc przebój ”Świt”. W czerwcu 2021 roku ukazał się trzeci, bestsellerowy album Darii pt. „Wojny i Noce”. Wszystkie albumy artystka współtworzyła wraz z wieloletnim przyjacielem i producentem - Michałem Kushem.",

    bio: "With his slicked-back hair and leather jacket, G-Eazy was known as 'the James Dean of rap' when he debuted in the late 2000s. Armed with bars that detailed hedonistic excess and conflicted inner turmoil, he steadily climbed the charts in the 2010s on the strength of his hit duet with Bebe Rexha, 'Me, Myself & I,' from his major-label debut, 2014's These Things Happen. He repeated that success in 2017 with third album The Beautiful & Damned, which paired him with Halsey on the platinum 'Him & I,' and A$AP Rocky and Cardi B on the Top Four hit 'No Limit.' Without losing any of his swagger, G-Eazy has matured, even singing and exploring a more introspective sound, as on the 2020 side project Everything's Strange Here and 2021 full-length These Things Happen Too. Born Gerald Earl Gillum in Oakland, California, G-Eazy launched his career while still in college at Loyola University in New Orleans, heading up a hip-hop crew named the Bay Boyz while releasing his solo debut, The Epidemic LP, in 2009. Two years later, his mixtape The Endless Summer landed with the hit redo of Dion's 'Runaround Sue.' In 2012 he released his second LP, Must Be Nice, hitting the road with Hoodie Allen and joining the Vans Warped Tour. In 2014 he returned with his first major-label release, These Things Happen (RCA). As his popularity grew in the following year, he embarked on an extensive international tour and recorded his fourth album. When It's Dark Out was released in late 2015 and included a hit duet with Bebe Rexha, 'Me, Myself & I.' Dark would go on to peak at number five on the Billboard 200 and top the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. In the summer of 2016, while on tour with Logic, YG, and Yo Gotti, Eazy appeared on Britney Spears' comeback single 'Make Me,' which entered the Top 20 of the Hot 100. 'Some Kind of Drug,' his single featuring Marc E. Bassy, arrived at the end of the year and would enter the singles charts in early 2017. At the beginning of the year, G-Eazy also teamed up with Carnage for the EP Step Brothers. By mid-year, he released the single 'No Limit,' which featured A$AP Rocky and Cardi B. The multi-platinum track climbed into the Top Five of the Hot 100, becoming his highest-charting single to date. This was followed by a second platinum chart hit, 'Him & I,' which featured his then-girlfriend Halsey. Both tracks were included on his third studio album, The Beautiful & Damned, which was released in December 2017. The double-disc set peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. In 2018 Eazy teamed up with Yo Gotti and YBN Nahmir for the single '1942,' which appeared on the Uncle Drew soundtrack. Eazy's 2019 output included the EP B-Sides, the single 'West Coast' featuring Blueface, and a bevy of features on tracks by Chris Brown, Carnage, and T-Pain. He closed the year with a second EP, Scary Nights, which recruited Moneybagg Yo, French Montana, Miguel, and others.In 2020, Eazy found inspiration in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking the opportunity to try new things and reflect. The results wound up on Everything's Strange Here, a drastic shift in style that set his rap braggadocio aside in favor of introspective indie alternative pop. Singing instead of rapping, he covered the Korgis and David Bowie, while also sampling Pixies. By the end of the year, he had also collaborated with Blackbear on the song 'Hate the Way,' before releasing his seventh studio album, 2021's These Things Happen Too. Included on the album, was the Hot 100 single 'Running Wild (Tumblr Girls 2) featuring Kossisko. There were also guest appearances by Demi Lovato, Lil Wayne, Marc E. Bassy, and others. It reached number 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-hop Albums chart and number 19 on the Billboard 200. After a year-long hiatus, Eazy returned in 2023 with the reflective single Tulips & Roses.

    bio: "Los Angeles' Julia Michaels is a gifted singer and songwriter with a bent toward R&B-inflected, dance-oriented pop. Before launching her performing career, Michaels had composed songs for Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran, Shakira, and many others. She then transitioned to feature roles, appearing on Jason Derulo's 'Trade Hearts' and Kygo's 'Carry Me.' Michaels released her debut solo single 'Issues' in 2017, which promptly went multi-platinum in the U.S., Australia, and Norway. Her first EP, Nervous System, arrived later that year, cracking the Top 50 of the Billboard 200. She also co-wrote and sang on Clean Bandit's hit single 'I Miss You,' which charted around the globe. Following a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist, she issued a series of EPs titled Inner Monologue in 2019.

At the age of 18, she founded the Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) Foundation which provides education and nutrition to over 6,000 impoverished children in Colombia. In October 2011, Shakira was named a member of President Obama’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. She served as coach on the 4th and 6th season of NBC's hit reality vocal competition series The Voice. Her tenth studio album Shakira was released in 2014, featuring hits such as Can’t Remember to Forget You, with Rihanna and La La La (Brazil 2014) which she performed at the finals of Fifa's World Cup 2014 in Brazil. In 2016, she starred as Gazelle in Disney’s record-breaking film Zootopia, as well as contributing to its soundtrack with Try Everything. She also launched La Bicicleta with fellow Colombian artist Carlos Vives, which remained #1 for 18 consecutive weeks in Colombia. It was followed up by Chantaje feat. Maluma. With over 2 billion views on YouTube, it is one of the platform’s biggest Latin hits in history. In November 2018 she wrapped her hugely successful El Dorado World Tour. 2019 saw the release of the concert film Shakira in Concert: El Dorado World Tour, which was shown in cinemas worldwide for one-night only.

    bio: "Six million album sales. Four top five studio albums, two of which hit the UK number one. World tours in front of 3.3 million people. Over 200 million Spotify streams. A 2007 single, This Is The Life, that went to number one in ten countries. Fifteen years of continued international success, in which she has resolutely and unfailingly gone her own way. And now her best album yet. The Human Demands, produced by Jim Abbiss of Arctic Monkeys / Kasabian fame, reconnects Macdonald with her alternative roots, and her ability to write classic songs that sound like they have always existed, albeit with a new, Bruce Springsteen-like widescreen grandeur and ambition that suits her powerful, resonant contralto. The album also takes on the kind of heavy themes most of us have to deal with sooner or later: falling in love, burning bridges, facing depression, growing up. All this from an acoustic guitar-playing indie rocker who only ever wanted to share a bill with Travis at Scotland’s T In The Park festival. She has weathered fifteen years of major success in music while remaining her own woman, but now, all these years later, Amy Macdonald is back where she began: with an album that captures the essence of who she is. “I’m back to making music I like and just putting it out in a pure way. It has given me a new love for what I do, all over again.”",

    bio: "Wham! followed the parallel path of most of their British pop peers, celebrating colorful, candied hooks and big, effervescent beats at a time most emerging U.K. groups were dedicated to stylish, detached synth pop. George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley, the childhood friends who comprised Wham!, didn't ignore fashion -- their flashy visuals were tailor-made for MTV -- but they shunned the arty and dour portions of new wave, building their persona on American dance music and pop, even dabbling in a bit of rap on their first single Wham! Rap (Enjoy What You Do). That single, along with Young Guns (Go for It) and Bad Boys, broke them into the U.K. Top Ten in 1983, but it was the jubilant Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go that turned them into international superstars. Almost immediately, Michael stood apart from Ridgeley: he had the supple, soulful voice showcased on their second number one, Careless Whisper, which was occasionally credited to Michael on his own. Wham! sustained their run at the top of the charts through 1985 but in 1986, A Different Corner announced Michael's separation from his longtime friend. By the end of that year, Wham! had split, leaving Michael on the road to superstardom. George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met as preteens attending Bushey Meads School in Hertfordshire, England. Becoming fast friends, the two played in a ska revival band named the Executive before leaving to form their own group. Inspired by American dance and R&B, the duo decided to call themselves Wham! because they believed it represented their sunny, kinetic chemistry. Signing with Innervision Records, Wham! released their debut single 'Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)' in June 1982 but it failed to gain much attention. That wasn't the case with 'Young Guns (Go for It),' another iteration of the group's youthful positivity. Reaching number three on the charts, 'Young Guns (Go for It)' ignited Wham!'s stardom in the U.K., leading to a re-release of 'Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)' that climbed into the Top Ten in early 1983. 'Bad Boys' and 'Club Tropicana' followed their predecessors into the Top Ten in 1983, establishing the duo as peers of the likes of Culture Club, who were the only other British band of that moment drawing so heavily on American R&B.

After an acrimonious split with Innervision, Wham! signed with Epic Records--in America, they signed Columbia, another CBS-run imprint--paving the way for a massive worldwide push for their second album, Make It Big. Accompanied by a bright, cheerful video where the duo, along with backing vocalists Pepsi and Shirlie, sported shirts proclaiming 'Choose Life,' lead single 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' became a number one hit around the globe in the summer of 1984, sparking a blockbuster year for Wham! that was filled with chart-topping singles, including the effervescent 'Freedom,' slinky 'Everything She Wants' and deceptively joyous 'Last Christmas,' which turned into an enduring instrumental standard. Among those number one hits was the ballad 'Careless Whisper,' a sultry slow jam that was promoted in some markets as a solo single by George Michael and in other countries as 'Wham! Featuring George Michael,' a puzzling choice considering it was one of the few Wham! singles co-written by Andrew Ridgeley. The credit confusion was the first indication that CBS viewed Michael as the true star of Wham! Despite this simmering internal tension, Wham! stayed active throughout 1985, beginning the year by being the first Western group to tour China. Footage from the tour would feature in the American video for 'Freedom,' which was released in the US in 1985, several months after it topped the British charts, and also provided the basis for the 1986 documentary Wham! In China: Foreign Skies. The buoyant single 'I'm Your Man' also reached number one in the UK late in the year but by that point, Michael was already planning to leave Wham! In March of 1986, he released the slow, contemplative 'A Different Corner' as a solo single. A few months later, he and Ridgeley made it official: they announced their next single, the spritely 'The Edge of Heaven' would be their last and they'd say farewell with an album aptly titled The Final, which contained older hits along with newer singles, including 'A Different Corner.' The release of The Final got a bit messy, with Wham!'s American record company whittling the album down to its newer material and entitling this collection Music from the Edge of Heaven. Not long after separating, George Michael released Faith, the 1987 album that cemented his superstardom. Andrew Ridgeley didn't have nearly as successful a recording career: after his 1990 debut Son of Albert failed to find an audience, he bowed out of music. The pair remained friends until Michael's untimely death on December 25, 2016. Ridgeley subsequently published a 2019 memoir called Wham! George & Me and also participated in the 2023 documentary Wham! ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine",

    bio: "Though his name is unfamiliar to most, Bobby Helms rules the airwaves every year around December 25th. His single Jingle Bell Rock first became a hit in 1957, and it reappeared on the charts four of the following five years to become an all-time Christmas classic. Before he was pigeonholed, though, Helms had a successful country career with two number one hits to his credit. Born on August 15, 1933, in Bloomington, IN, Helms first performed on his father Fred's Monroe County Jamboree, singing while brother Freddie played guitar. The Helms Brothers, as they were billed, became a regional attraction. Bobby later cut a single called 'Tennessee Rock and Roll,' but then returned to Bloomington to appear on the Hayloft Frolic television show. While on the program, he was encouraged to go to Nashville to sing background vocals on an Ernest Tubb session. Tubb recommended him to Decca Records, and the label signed him in 1956. His debut single, 'Fraulein,' initially flopped in January 1957 but then hit number one on the country chart in April. (The song also hit the pop Top 40 in July of 1957.) In October, Helms released another number one, 'My Special Angel,' which stayed four weeks at the top and crossed over to number seven pop. Helms' next recording was 'Jingle Bell Rock'; though Decca released it only two days before Christmas 1957, the single still peaked at number six on the pop chart. Two 1958 singles -- 'Just a Little Lonesome' and 'Jacqueline' -- hit the country Top Ten but flopped elsewhere, though a reissue of 'Jingle Bell Rock' made the pop Top 40. The country single 'Lonely River Rhine' hit the Top 20 in 1960, but subsequent new material from Helms had little success. (Decca reissued his Christmas hit each year from 1960 to 1962 with diminishing returns.) Helms toured throughout the '60s and recorded two albums for Kapp in 1966, I'm the Man and Sorry My Name Isn't Fred -- a nod either to brother Freddie or father Fred. Two years later, he released All New Just for You on the Little Darlin' label. Several singles placed modestly on the country charts during 1967-1968, including 'He Thought He'd Die Laughing' and 'So Long.' The 1970 Certron single 'Mary Goes 'Round' was his last hit, but Helms recorded Pop-a-Billy for MCA as late as 1983. ~ John Bush, Rovi",

    bio: "Carly Rae Jepsen’s pristine, prismatic pop has long been the blissful soundtrack for first kisses and swirling romances, but the multi-platinum Grammy, Juno and Polaris Prize nominated Canadian star’s knack for distilling a sea of emotions into brilliant songcraft has wooed critics as deeply as fans. The singer, songwriter, and actress first burst onto the international scene in 2012 with the sly and sublime “Call Me Maybe.” That blockbuster hit from her breakthrough album, Kiss, topped charts in over 47 countries, sold over 20 million singles, and was certified Diamond in the U.S. It also earned her two Grammy nominations for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year. On her 2015 synth-pop stunner E*MO*TION, Jepsen collaborated with Sia, Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes, and Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend), expanding her sonic palette with shimmery synths and euphoric dance beats that channel the sugary rush of new flirtations. Noisey declared it the pop album of the year, while the beaming single “I Really Like You” went platinum. Her 2019 follow-up, Dedicated, covered even more musical and emotional ground, as our most hopeful romantic continued to chase her bliss through a breakup. The Atlantic called the album “brilliant” with its “godlike bops.” Jepsen returned again in May 2020 with a gift for her fans: Dedicated Side B, a buoyant set of dance-floor candy that affirmed her status as pop’s undefeatable ambassador of love.",

    bio: "When Nelly Furtado appeared with her neo-hippie, multiculti debut Whoa, Nelly! in 2001, a dance-diva makeover seemed like an impossibility, but the singer/songwriter revived and sustained her career with the sexually charged Loose in 2006, and in the process, consolidated her position as one of the most unpredictable artists of her decade. Furtado always proudly displayed her Portuguese heritage, a distinction that separated her from legions of emerging female singer/songwriters in the early days of the new millennium, but her uniqueness didn’t end there: she had an ear for elliptical yet memorable melodies, and a taste for Brit-pop balanced by an immersion in modern R&B and hip-hop. All this surfaced on Whoa, Nelly! and its hits 'Turn Off the Light' and 'I'm Like a Bird,' but she really pushed her rhythmic influences to the forefront on Loose, resulting in 'Promiscuous' and 'Maneater,' her biggest hits yet, suggesting that Furtado had many avenues yet to explore. A native of the Canadian city of Victoria, Furtado was a musically precocious child, learning to play a variety of instruments and singing in choirs, spending as much time listening to modern R&B like Mariah Carey and TLC as she did Brit-pop, eventually winding her way toward hip-hop and Brazilian music. Upon her high school graduation, she headed to Toronto, soon joining the hip-hop duo Nelstar. Not long afterward, the duo of Brian West and Gerald Eaton, core members of the Philosopher Kings, produced the Furtado demo that led to her contract with DreamWorks. Whoa, Nelly!, her first album, appeared in late 2000 and DreamWorks built the album gradually, capitalizing on strong reviews and a supporting slot for Moby, with the record truly taking off when 'I'm Like a Bird' turned into a hit on a road that led to a Grammy for Song of the Year. This was one of four Grammy nominations and several hits including 'Turn Off the Light,' which displayed her rhythmic roots in a way 'I'm Like a Bird' did not. Furtado had a daughter as she was working on her second album, and her new role as a mother was evident on Folklore. Released in November 2003, it was an ambitious album with a world music aesthetic that garnered some good reviews along with some negative notices, and it failed to generate a hit. The album also suffered from under-promotion due to DreamWorks' acquisition by Universal Music Group, a situation that eventually led to Furtado landing at Geffen Records. Nonetheless, Folklore garnered some positive attention, with the single 'Força' used as the theme to the 2004 European Football Championship. Perhaps the under-performance and troubled release of that album pushed Furtado toward the musical makeover of Loose, the 2006 effort produced largely by hip-hop superstar Timbaland. Heavy on grooves and overtly sexual, Loose had a pair of smash singles: 'Promiscuous,' which was a chart-topper in the U.S., and 'Maneater,' which performed the same feat in the U.K. Both singles set the soundtrack for 2006 around the world, helping the album shift seven million copies internationally. Her star status fortified, Furtado took her time delivering a follow-up, releasing her first Spanish-language album, Mi Plan, in September 2009. A collection of remixes from Mi Plan appeared a year later, followed just a few weeks later by The Best of Nelly Furtado. Her fifth studio album, the largely positive and upbeat The Spirit Indestructible, was released in fall 2012. Executive produced by Furtado, the album also showcased collaborations with a bevy of studio heavy weights, including Darkchild, Salaam Remi, Bob Rock, Fraser T. Smith, John Shanks, Tiësto, and others. The album produced several singles, including 'Big Hoops (Bigger the Better),' and while it failed to match the commercial success of Loose, it garnered favorable attention, including a nomination for Pop Album of the Year at the Juno Awards in 2013. Furtado continued to make live concert appearances over the next several years, including singing the Canadian National Anthem at the 2016 NBA All-Star Game in Toronto. Also in 2016, she severed ties with Interscope, announced her sixth studio album The Ride, and released the moody, synth-inflected single 'Pipe Dreams.' Produced by John Congleton, The Ride appeared in early 2017. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi",

    bio: "A Juno-winning and Grammy-nominated pop singer/songwriter who broke records with his debut single, Canada's Shawn Mendes became known to international audiences when he was just 15. His mix of Ed Sheeran's and Justin Bieber's styles was a hit from his first single, 2014's 'Life of the Party,' which made him the youngest artist to land a debut single in the Top 25 in the U.S. His full-length debut, 2015's Handwritten, went to number one in the U.S. and Canada, a feat repeated by releases including 2018's Shawn Mendes and 2020's Wonder. Mendes also found success with stand-alone singles like 2021's Tainy collaboration 'Summer of Love' and his solo cut 'It'll Be Okay.' In 2022, he voiced the lead character and sang on the soundtrack to the musical film Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile. A year later, he offered the climate change-inspired single 'What the Hell Are We Dying For?' Born and raised in Pickering, Ontario, in Greater Toronto, Shawn Peter Raul Mendes taught himself guitar at the age of 14. He also sang in his school's glee club and took acting lessons as a teen. After posting a series of cover songs to various video-sharing sites beginning in 2013, he earned a dedicated following. His version of A Great Big World's 'Say Something' won Ryan Seacrest's cover-song contest in April 2014, and Mendes signed to Island Records a month later. That June, they released the then-15-year-old's debut single 'Life of the Party.' American radio initially ignored it, but the track entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 24, making Mendes the youngest artist to land their first single in the Top 25. The song was also included on his four-track Island debut, The Shawn Mendes EP, which performed well, reaching number five on the Billboard charts and setting the stage for his full-length debut, 2015's Handwritten. Handwritten debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, and Norway, also reaching the Top Ten in several other European countries. Meanwhile, Mendes had his first U.S. Top Ten hit with third single 'Stitches,' reaching number four while topping the singles chart in the U.K. In addition, his song 'Believe' appeared on the soundtrack for the Disney Channel fantasy musical Descendants. While opening for Taylor Swift on the North American dates of her 1989 World Tour, Mendes and Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello collaborated on the song 'I Know What You Did Last Summer,' which was included on a deluxe version of Handwritten that arrived in November 2015. The song reached the Top 20 of the American and Canadian singles charts. Recorded in upstate New York and issued in September 2016, Mendes' second long-player, Illuminate, offered the Top Ten tracks 'Treat You Better' and 'There's Nothin' Holdin' Me Back.' Featuring co-songwriting contributions from Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris, the album debuted at number one in the U.S. and Canada, and 'There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back' went on to win a Juno Award for Single of the Year. Illuminate was followed in December by the digital-only Live at Madison Square Garden. Mendes launched a massive world tour in April 2017, which included a live acoustic session for MTV Unplugged that was released in November. In April 2018, Mendes performed his song 'In My Blood' at a concert for Queen Elizabeth II's 92nd birthday at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The track's lyrics explored the songwriter's struggles with anxiety disorder and was later released as the lead single for his third full-length, Shawn Mendes, which arrived in May of that year. Featuring collaborations with Geiger, it debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, and Australia and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album alongside the lead single's nomination for Song of the Year. In Canada, the eponymous LP collected Juno Awards for Pop Album and Album of the Year, and Mendes won Artist and Songwriter of the Year. 'In My Blood' earned him yet another Juno, his second for Single of the Year. A deluxe version of Shawn Mendes followed later in 2019 containing the hit singles 'If I Can't Have You' and 'Señorita.' Again featuring Camila Cabello, 'Señorita' became a global chart-topper that picked up a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. 'Wonder,' the title track and first single from Mendes' fourth album, went to number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 after its October 2020 release, while its sequel 'Monster' -- a duet with Justin Bieber -- peaked at eight. Wonder appeared on December 4, 2020, reaching number one in both the U.S. and Canada. A non-album collaboration with Tainy, 'Summer of Love,' arrived in August 2021, followed a few months later by the solo track 'It'll Be Okay.' The singles continued the following year with 'When You're Gone.' Mendes voiced the titular anthropomorphic saltwater crocodile in the family musical film Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile (2022), for which he also contributed the songs 'Carried Away' and 'Heartbeat,' among others. In June 2023, Mendes issued the track 'What the Hell Are We Dying For?' Written and recorded only days before its release, the song was centered around the effects of climate change, and its cover depicted the New York skyline through the orange haze smoke from devastating Canadian wildfires. ~ Marcy Donelson & David Jeffries, Rovi",

    bio: "Mixing reggae, R&B, hip-hop, and pop, German singer Oceana came on the world stage in 2012 when her track Endless Summer was selected as the official theme of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship. Born Oceana Mahlmann near Hamburg, her 2009 single Cry Cry was her first hit, becoming somewhat popular in her homeland while topping the charts in Hungary. Her debut album, Love Supply, would arrive on the  label that same year. Three years later, her single Endless Summer became the 2012 UEFA European Football Championship theme, held that year in Poland and the Ukraine. It was released in both a dance-pop and a reggae mix. ~ David Jeffries, Rovi",

    bio: "Colombia's Karol G is a best-selling, chart-topping, award-winning vocalist known for her soulful mix of reggaeton, pop, and dance-oriented R&B. Her many collaborative singles appearances with other urbano stars including , Anuel AA, , , , and , regularly placed inside the Top 100, while their accompanying videos garnered hundreds of millions of views. Though she issued her first single at 16 in 2007, she struggled for the next decade establishing herself in reggaeton because it was a male-dominated genre. It took ten years, more than a billion YouTube views, and hundreds of millions of music streams before she could release her debut LP, Unstoppable, in 2017. Two years later, her profile rose to the level of a bona fide star thanks to chart-topping singles such as Tusa with , China with Anuel AA, , , and , and Ocean, the title track from her number 22 sophomore long-player. In 2020 Karol G was a nearly constant presence on the charts with many collaborations -- including Enjoy Yourself with  and Follow with Anuel AA -- and solo singles such as Ay, Dios Mío! and Bichota. In March 2021, she issued her third long-player, the chart-topping KG0516. Her fourth set, 2023's Mañana Será Bonito, took her to even greater heights, winning multiple Grammys into 2024.",
